# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers - README

Welcome to the README file for ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers! This document provides an in-depth guide and summary of utilizing prompt engineering techniques with ChatGPT to enhance your development workflow.

## Overview

ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful AI language model capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives. Prompt engineering involves crafting specific prompts to guide ChatGPT's responses towards desired outcomes. For developers, this approach can streamline various tasks, from generating code snippets to aiding in problem-solving and more.

## Types of Large Language Models (LLMs)

There are two main types of Large Language Models:
- **Base LLMs**: These models predict the next word based on the text training data.
- **Instruction Tuned LLMs**: These models attempt to follow specific instructions provided to them.

## Setup

To begin using ChatGPT and OpenAI's services, set up your environment as follows:

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

## Helper Function

Simplify interactions with OpenAI's models using the provided helper function:

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,  # Controls the degree of randomness in the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Principles of Prompting

### Principle 1 - Clear and Specific Instructions

- **Tactic 1**: Utilize delimiters to clearly define instructions.
- **Tactic 2**: Request structured output when necessary.
- **Tactic 3**: Ensure conditions are met and assumptions are understood.
- **Tactic 4**: Use few-shot prompting to guide the model based on previous successful examples.

### Principle 2 - Give Model Time to Think

- **Tactic 1**: Outline the steps required for task completion.
- **Tactic 2**: Encourage the model to derive its own solutions before reaching a conclusion.

## Iterative Prompt Development

### Prompt Guidelines

1. **Be Clear and Specific**: Precision is key.
2. **Analyze Results**: Understand why outputs may not align with expectations.
3. **Refine Prompt**: Iterate with examples to enhance clarity.
4. **Repeat**: Continuously refine and adjust prompts based on feedback and outcomes.

### Issues and Solutions

- **Issue 1**: Text length is too long.
  - Specify desired length in words or characters.
- **Issue 2**: Text focuses on irrelevant details.
  - Emphasize aspects relevant to the target audience.
- **Issue 3**: Description lacks organization.
  - Extract information and present it in a structured format, such as a table.

## Summarizing

Summarization involves condensing information with a focus on a specific topic. When prompts generate unrelated responses, consider using 'extract' to hone in on the desired subject.

## Interference

Understanding emotions or sentiments from text can sometimes interfere with the intended task. Leveraging LLMs trained in emotion recognition can mitigate this challenge.

## Possible Uses

Explore various applications of prompt engineering, including emotion identification, multitasking, text transformation, expansion of ideas, and temperature control to adjust model outputs.

By following these guidelines and leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities effectively, developers can optimize their workflow and unlock new possibilities in their projects.
